                <p>First they take the dinglebop, and they smooth it out with a bunch of schleem. The schleem is then repurposed for later batches. They take the dinglebop and push it through the krumbo, where the fleeb is rubbed against it. It's important that the fleeb is rubbed, because the fleeb has all of the fleeb juice. Then a schlomi shows up, and rubs it, and spits on it. They cut the fleeb. There are several hizzards in the way. The blamphs rub against the trumbles, and the plubus and grumbo are shaved away. That leaves you with a regular old plumbus.</p>

                <p>The Microverse Battery contains a miniature universe with a planet inhabited by intelligent life. These lifeforms use kinetic devices, which were given to them by Rick, to produce electricity. ... The people of this world consider Rick to be a benevolent alien, when in fact, he is using them as slaves.</p>

                <p>The Portal Gun is a gadget that allows the user(s) to travel between different universes/dimensions/realities. The Gun was likely created by a Rick, although it is unknown which one; if there is any truth to C-137's fabricated origin story, then he may not be the original inventor.  </p>
